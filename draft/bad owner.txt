Bad owner or permissions on $HOME/.ssh/config
The ssh with RHEL 4 is a lot more anal about security checking. In my case, it was the fact that $HOME/.ssh/config was group-writable which was causing it to barf. To fix:

$ cd ~/.ssh
$ chmod 600 *
Note that this error message is kind of stupid, since $HOME/.ssh had permissions 700 on it, and $HOME had 750 permissions on it. If any process managed to evade those permissions, changing the permissions on the config file would be similarly defeated.
